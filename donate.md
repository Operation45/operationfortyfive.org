## Operation 45: Transparency and Accountability for the Administration of Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States.

Democracy cannot meaningfully function without an informed citizenry, and such a citizenry is impossible without broad public access to information about the operations of government. If our government is to be accountable to the people, Donald Trump must not be allowed to conduct his presidency from the shadows. Help us shine the light.

*We are a 501(c)(3) non-profit charitable organization dedicated to governmental transparency in the service of democracy. Our tax ID number is 81-4440045. Your gift is tax-deductible to the full extent provided by law.*
