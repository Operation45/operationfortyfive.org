# About Us

#### Operation 45: Transparency and Accountability for the Administration of Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States.

Described by The Nation as "[a ray of hope in these dark political times](https://www.thenation.com/article/your-guide-to-the-sprawling-new-anti-trump-resistance-movement/)", Operation 45 is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization founded by "[transparency luminaries](https://www.gofundme.com/operation-45)" [Ryan Shapiro](https://twitter.com/_rshapiro) (MIT/Harvard) and [Jeffrey Light](https://twitter.com/_lightlaw). Our mission is the aggressive pursuit of governmental transparency in the service of democracy. Most immediately, Operation 45 is dedicated to ensuring transparency and accountability for the Trump/Pence administration.

Given Trump’s authoritarian aspirations and overt contempt for the Constitution, a free press, and civil liberties, the foundational institutions of American democracy now face a profoundly clear and present danger.

The need for transparency has never been greater. Yet the already challenging task of uncovering what our government is really up to is getting even harder.

Fortunately, liberating government documents against powerful opposition is what we do.  Our work obtaining and analyzing documents has provided vital information to journalists at media outlets including the New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, USA Today, US News & World Report, The Associated Press, NPR, BBC, The Guardian, The Nation, Mother Jones, Democracy Now!, WIRED, Motherboard, Vice News, and numerous others.

The open government website MuckRock describes Shapiro as "a [FOIA superhero](https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2013/dec/20/requesters-voice-ryan-shapiro-street-fighting-fbi-/)." Marsh Professor of Journalism at Michigan University and TED Senior Fellow Will Potter describes Shapiro as "[The FBI’s Worst Nightmare](http://www.greenisthenewred.com/blog/ryan-shapiro-fbi-lawsuit/7365/)." Indeed, the FBI itself declares Shapiro’s dissertation FOIA research methodologies themselves to be a threat to national security. Shapiro thanks the Bureau for this compliment.

#### Democracy cannot meaningfully function without an informed citizenry, and such a citizenry is impossible without broad public access to information about the operations of government. If our government is to be accountable to the people, Donald Trump must not be allowed to conduct his presidency from the shadows. Help us shine the light.
